We use Java on the robot. Specifically we use the WPILIB framework. We register callbacks with the framework
and WPILIB calls our code as appropriate.

We use Eclipse as the IDE. Eclipse is a good Java editor. Eclipse has plugins for WPILIB that lets us download code
and remotely debug code from within the IDE.

We use GIT (where you are now) to hold our code.
